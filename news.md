Good news for OpenCollar! After many trials with mainland parcels where we do not have full control, we set sail and made landfall in the private region Glint, a land owned by the makers of Mama Allpa, who generously offered us haven there. In Glint OpenCollar has full estate rights and much better security. For a brief while, our legacy Temple on the mainland will remain open. As always we offer full transparency in our project and you can already check out the new spot. www.opencollar.at
