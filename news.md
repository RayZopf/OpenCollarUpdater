Contributors are highly encouraged to make use of the sandbox at http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Keraxic/15/230/23 It's awesome we can have a place to build peacefully and everyone is most welcome to also rez collars there for running updates. If the temple at http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Glint/42/97/46 is too busy for you, we put a mini temple at http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Qandico/219/158/1234 We will keep both places open as long as we can. Love & peace! <3
